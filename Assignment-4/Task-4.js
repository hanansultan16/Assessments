// Write a program that defines a variable named test and initialize it with 32767. Display the value. 
// Then add one (1) to test and display the value. Then subtract one(1) from test and display the value. 
// Write your observation for three value assignments you done.

let test = 32767;
console.log(test);
test = test + 1;
console.log(test);

console.log(test);

// Observation: The value of test is 32767. 
// When 1 is added to test, the value becomes 32768. 
// When 1 is subtracted from test, the value becomes 32767 again.
